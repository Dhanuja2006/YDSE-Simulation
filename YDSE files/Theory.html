    <H2>THEORY:</H2>
    <br>
    <p>Young's double slit experiment is fundamendamental experiment in the feild of physics that
       provides storong evidence for wave nature of light. The experiment demonstrates the phenomenon
       of interference, which occurs when waves overlap and interact with each other.
       <br><br>
       Young's double-slit experiment typically involves a barrier with two narrow slits (the double 
       slit) through which light or other waves can pass. Behind the slits is a screen that records the
       pattern formed by the waves.
       <br><br>
       A source of monochromatic light, such as a laser, is used to illuminate the double slit. 
       Monochromatic light consists of a single wavelength, which is essential for this experiment.
       When the monochromatic light passes through the double slit, it behaves like a wave. The waves 
       emanating from the two slits overlap and interfere with each other as they propagate to the 
       screen. This interference produces a distinctive pattern of alternating light and dark regions on
       the screen.The resulting pattern on the screen shows alternating bright and dark bands, known as
       interference fringes. The bright bands correspond to constructive interference, where the waves 
       from both slits reinforce each other, creating a brighter spot. The dark bands represent 
       destructive interference, where the waves from the two slits cancel each other out, creating a 
       darker spot.The interference pattern can only be explained by the wave nature of light. If 
       light behaved solely as particles (photons), you would not see this characteristic pattern.</p>

    <H2>FORMULA:</H2>
    <br>
    <P><H3>FOR CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE:</H3>
            x=nλD/d<br>
        <H3>FOR DESTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE:</H3>
            x=(2n-1)λD/d  (for n=1,2,3,4,5.....)<br>
            x=(2n+1)λD/d  (for n=0,1,2,3,4.....)
    </P>
    <br>
    <H3>CONCLUSION:</H3>
    <br>
    <p>This experiment played a crucial role in the development of the wave theory of light and the 
       confirmation of the wave-particle duality of light, where light exhibits both wave-like and 
       particle-like behavior depending on how it is observed.</p>
